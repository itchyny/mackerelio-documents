## Aurora’s VolumeBytesUsed added to the list of obtainable metrics with AWS Integration - RDS

The Amazon Aurora cluster-level metric `VolumeBytesUsed` has been added to the list of metrics available with [AWS Integration - RDS](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/integrations/aws/rds). This metric relates to the storage capacity used by an Aurora DB instance. For a more detailed description, please refer to the AWS documentation ([Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Monitoring.html)). This metric is generated for each cluster and instances of the same cluster display the same metric.

## Fixed: Some widgets not updating with mkr dashboards push

In mkr v0.44.2, the issue regarding alert status widgets and numeric widgets not updating with `mkr dashboards push` has been fixed.



## Removed ‘type’ and added ‘size’ to the response of the API used to get host information

The response content of [the API used to get host information](https://mackerel.io/api-docs/entry/hosts#get) has been modified. `type` has been removed and `size` has been added. These changes are supported for both mackerel-client-ruby v0.10.0 and mackerel-client-go v0.16.0.

<b>Removed</b>

- type：classification of the host（"agent", "container-agent", "cloud" etc.）

<b>Added</b>

- size：host type（"standard" or  "micro"）


`size` lets you retrieve whether the target host is a standard host or a micro host using the API.

See the link below for API specifications.
