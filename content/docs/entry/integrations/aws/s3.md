Mackerel supports obtaining and monitoring <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> metrics in AWS Integration. When integrating with AWS Integration, billable targets are determined using the conversion 1 bucket = 1 Micro Host.

Please refer to the following page for AWS Integration configuration methods and a list of supported AWS services.<br>
<a href="https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/integrations/aws">AWS Integration</a>

<b><u>Additionally, in order to integrate, bucket request metrics must be configured in S3.
Refer to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/configure-request-metrics-bucket.html">Creating a CloudWatch metrics configuration for all the objects in your bucket</a> regarding configuration methods.</u></b><br>

- Set the filter name to `EntireBucket`.

## Obtaining metrics
The metrics obtainable with AWS Integration's support for S3 are as follows. For `Metric` explanations, refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/us_en/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cloudwatch-monitoring.html" target="_blank">AWS help page</a>.

The maximum number of obtainable metrics can be calculated using the formula `21 + 1 Ã— (Number of storage types)`

Enter the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html" target="_blank">storage class</a> in place of `STORAGE_TYPE` in the metric name.

|Bucket Size|BucketSizeBytes|s3.bucket_size.STORAGE_TYPE|bytes|Average|
|Number Of Objects|NumberOfObjects|s3.number_of_objects.count|float|Average|

- Either "FirstByte" or "TotalRequest" goes in for the # under "Metric name in Mackerel".

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
- Since S3 is a global service, integration with S3 is possible regardless of the region selected.
- Filters can be defined for request metrics, however metrics for the entire bucket are retrieved in AWS Integration.
- Of the graphs/metrics obtainable with AWS integration, metrics included in following graphs will be retrieved at a daily interval.
    - Bucket Size
    - Number Of Objects
