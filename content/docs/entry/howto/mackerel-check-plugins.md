## Installing the official check plugin pack

### Linux OS

We recommend using yum or apt repositories for installation, depending on your environment. The repository is set up when you do [Register a new Host](https://mackerel.io/my/instruction-agent); if you want to get the rpm or deb files directly, please refer to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mackerelio/mackerel-agent-plugins/releases).

#### rpm package

```
sudo yum install mackerel-check-plugins
```

Updates can be performed using the following command.

```
sudo yum update mackerel-check-plugins
```

#### deb package

```
sudo apt-get install mackerel-check-plugins
```

Updates can be performed using the following command.ã€‚

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mackerel-check-plugins
```

### Windows Server

Official check plugins are bundled with the agent. See [List of Plugins](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/plugins/check-plugins-list) for a list of included plugins. For information on how to install the agent, see [Registering a New Host](https://mackerel.io/my/instruction-agent).

Updating the agent will also update the included plugins. See [Installing mackerel-agent on Windows](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/howto/install-agent/msi) for instructions on how to update.

Plugins that are not included are not officially supported and must be built by the user.

## Using the official check plugin pack

### Linux OS

Each plugin will be installed in `/usr/bin`, so you will need to add the item shown below to the mackerel-agent settings file for the plugins you will be using. To apply the settings, you will need to restart the mackerel-agent.

If you wanted to, for example, use the process monitoring plugin to monitor crond, you would add the following item.

```config
[plugin.checks.check_cron]
command = ["check-procs", "-p", "crond"]
```

### Windows Server

Each plugin is stored in the agent's installation folder and has its own path. add the following settings to mackerel-agent's configuration file according to the plugin you are using. Restarting mackerel-agent is required for the settings to take effect.

To monitor the process "foobar" using the process monitoring plugin, use the following description.

```config
[plugin.checks.check_foobar]
command = ["check-procs", "-p", "foobar"]
```

## Usage example

- [Monitoring Logs](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/howto/check/log)
- [Monitoring Processes](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/howto/check/process)
- [Running checks on TCP servers](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/howto/check/tcp)
