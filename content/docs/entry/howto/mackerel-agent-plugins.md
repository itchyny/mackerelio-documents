By using the official plugin, which supports many different kinds of middleware, itâ€™s easy to gather middleware metrics. Supported environments will be the same as `mackerel-agent`, so for more information about that please refer to our [outline of supported environments](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/overview#support-environments).

In order to monitor metrics for AWS services like ELB or RDS, consider using [AWS Integration](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/integrations/aws). As for the posting of service metrics, please use [fluentd](http://www.fluentd.org/). For more information please refer to [Posting metrics related to ELB from AWS CloudWatch to service metrics.](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/advanced/fluentd#example-elb)

See below for plugins included in the official plugin pack.

### Windows Server

Official plugins are bundled with the agent. See [List of Plugins](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/plugins/metric-plugins-list) for a list of included plugins. For information on how to install the agent, see [Registering a New Host](https://mackerel.io/my/instruction-agent).

Updating the agent will also update the included plugins. See [Installing mackerel-agent on Windows](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/howto/install-agent/msi) for instructions on how to update.

Plugins that are not included are not officially supported and must be built by the user.

## Using the official plugin pack

### Windows Server

Each plugin is stored in the agent's installation folder and has its own path. add the following settings to mackerel-agent's configuration file according to the plugin you are using. Restarting mackerel-agent is required for the settings to take effect.
